# Online Quiz

## Getting Started

On this assignment I was tasked to create an online quiz for others to take. This will have a series of timed multiple choice questions and a highscores list.  

## What I did

  * First I created the default folders and HTML files I will need to build the project
  * I then built the index page very simply with a title, header, and two buttons
  * Next, I built the css stylesheet to contain the basics of what I would need
  * I made sure to have all elements centered
  * Buttons would have purple text, borders, and shadow
