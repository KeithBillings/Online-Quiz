## Getting Started

On this assignment I was tasked to create an online quiz for others to take. This will have a series of timed multiple choice questions and a highscores list.

## What I did

  * First I created the default folders and HTML files I will need to build the project
  * I then built the index page very simply with a title, header, and two buttons
  * Next, I built the css stylesheet to contain the basics of what I would need
  * I made sure to have all elements centered
  * Buttons would have purple text, borders, and shadow
  * Build and style main testing page
  * Add test questions based on greek lore to an array
  * Write a function to pull from the array and dynamically update the html list
  * Write a function to determine if what the user clicks on is correct or not
  * Add user selection to total score if correct
  * Add score to local storage 
  * Build and style end page
  * Have highscore represented by most recent player score
  * Add functionality to highscores list
  * Debug
  * Add 60 second timer and functionality
  * Debug
  * Make incorrect answers subtract 10 seconds from the timer
  * Make quiz end at 0 or less seconds
